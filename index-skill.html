The worst thing you could ever do as a baker is to turn down your first order because the design is too complex for you. What if the second order bares the same mark and next one after that? You cannot get into the baking business for simple baked products. As long as you have announced yourself as a baker clients will come with challenging designs and if you got into the game before perfecting your skills you will run into a lot of problems.<br>
Imagine you have a tray of eggs and you have one order, you use ten eggs and the  cake comes out bad and you decide to redo the cake and you use tens more eggs. Let us not forget about the flour and other ingredients. Your second bet does not get anywhere as well and you go for the third time running down a whole tray of eggs for a single order and you have no idea whether the third try will be a hit. It is going to be costly if you do not perfect your skill set before you go commercial.<br>
In business, confidence is absolutely critical. Successful business owners are, by definition, confident entrepreneurs. You need the confidence to start a business, to believe in your products and services, and that you’re making the right strategic decisions. Now, being a generally confident person doesn’t necessarily translate to being a self-assured entrepreneur or baker.<br> Maintaining ongoing confidence in your business is simply much easier said than done. There are just so many factors at play that can shake your optimism as a business owner if you’re not prepared. It starts with the right set of skills. If you keep failing and getting it wrong most of the time it will kill your confidence and that is bad for business.<br>
The right skill set will set you up for a progressive growing business. You will not be in the same place for a long time and it will be easier for you to evolve to the next level and establish yourself as an A+ professional baker. <br>
The right skill set ensures that you design your product and deliver it on time thereby building trust and royalty with clients. If you are running on amateur wheels you will constantly disappoint your customers with bad service and bad product. Lack of skill is a good recipe to sink your own ship.<br>
In village bricks are baked to hold the house anything that is not baked creates a weak point and whole house could crumble. So pay extreme attention to your level of skill. Consult with friends by sharing your product and get professional opinion from established bakers. Have a cake testing events and learn from feedback.
