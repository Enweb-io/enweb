It is not acceptable for a husband to forget his wife’s birthday. She was born once and that special time comes once in a year. Hubby should look forward to that day and plan and prepare how he is going to treat his wife like the queen she is. Awe sure he forget, he even goes home and fights with his wife not knowing that it is her birthday. Guess what, the wife will not remind him she will just let him, until someone asks him what he did for his wife on her birthday. That is when he picks the phone and makes a desperate call to order a belated birthday cake for his only wife.<br>
I know wives too forget their husband’s birthday but I have never encountered a female client ordering a belated birthday cake for her husband only husbands and quite a number. All the calls received were husband begging for an emergency order for a belated birthday cake for their wives. When they were granted the order they became the most satisfied customers in the history of human existance.<br>
Some of them remember before the day is over and try to order a cake only to be told that it is too late, there is not enough time, try another cakery we are overwhelmed. When you give a desperate customer the order you add a royal customer to your client base and they will put your cakery on top of the list. Taking last minute orders creates and retains loyal customers and they will love, thank, praise and recommend your products to friends and family.<br>
Such practice have always built strong relationships with  customer bases to encourage client retention, expand sales portfolios, inspire repeat business, and turn customers into fans and brand advocates.<br>

However, in an economy increasingly dominated by ecommerce, building meaningful customer relationships has gotten harder. While most brands have seen the size of their audience dramatically increase thanks to online shopping and digital marketing, scaling the personalization required for trust and transparency is complicated. Therefore make it ease by doing everything you can to expand your client base and one way to do that is to service desperate clients. As long as the phone is on take orders even at 23 hours, do not turn it off that working hours are over. Each time you lose a customer you give them up to your competition.<br>

Strong customer relationships are as crucial as ever, other practices include, Provide great customer service, Understand your customers, Personalize your communication, take complaints seriously, listen to customers, run promotion and get closer, Create value, Reward customer loyalty with a freebies, cap, T-shirt, cupcakes or a mug with you logo on it, Exceed expectations,Communicate consistently and build trust and Get customer feedback.<br>
