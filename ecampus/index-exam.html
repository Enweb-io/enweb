            There are always various activities that can be done separately or combined in enhancing one’s experience. Herewith, there are few guidelines respectively outlined to serve as a practical reference.<br><br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">1. Give yourself enough time to study</span><br>

Make a study schedule that fits your way of studying and do not leave anything for the last minute. While some students do seem to thrive on last-minute studying, often this way of partial studying is not the best approach for exam preparation. Write down how many exams you have, how many pages you have to learn, and the days you have left. Afterwards, organize your study habits accordingly.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">2. Make sure your study space is organized</span><br>
sure you have enough space on your desk to spread your textbooks and notes. Ensuring that the room is sufficiently bright and your chair restful enough are also points to consider. Pay attention to details that can distract you and remove them from your study space. Make sure that you feel comfortable in your study space and that you are able to focus. For some individuals, this may mean complete silence, while for others listening to music helps. Some of us need complete order to focus, while others like to study in a more cluttered environment. Make sure your study space is friendly and 
pleasant so that you can fully concentrate.<br><br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">3. Keep Track of Your Progress</span><br>

What have you covered so far and how much more you need. By the time the exam approaches you should have covered everything. Do not take any risks. At the start of a topic, write down everything you already know about the subject. Closer to the exam, transform your revision notes in a powerful weapon.<br><br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">4. Practice on old exams</span><br>

One of the most effective ways to prepare for exams is to practice with an old version of previous exams. Also, an old test will help you see the format and formulation of the questions and it will be good for you to know what to expect but also as a worthy practice for measuring the time you need for the actual test.<br><br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">5. Explain your answers to others<</span>br>

With the help of your family and friends, you could excel on your exam. Explain them your reasoning for why you have answered a certain question in a certain way. This also effective during class discussions.<br><br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">6. Organize study groups with friends</span><br>

Study groups can help you get the answers you need and finish tasks faster. Just make sure the group is focused on the subject and they are not easily distracted.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">7. Take regular breaks</span><br>

Regular breaks are needed for the brain to regain its focus. It is not the best tactic to study long hours because long-term retention of knowledge is almost impossible. The most important part of studying is to develop a routine that fits your study style. <br> 

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">8. Snacking on healthy food is good for the brain</span><br>
You should not eat unhealthy food while you are studying. Keep your body and brain fit by choosing natural, fresh and vitamins rich food that is good for you and would improve your concentration and memory.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">9. Plan the day of your exams</span><br>

Check all the rules and requirements for the exam. Plan your route and the time it may take you to reach your destination – then add on some extra time. You do not want to arrive late and deal with even more anxiety.<br>

            <p style ="text-align:justify; font-size:16px;">"You’ve got to get up every morning with determination if you’re going to go to bed with satisfaction."
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p style ="text-align:justify; font-size:16px;"><span style ="font-weight:bold;">10. Drink plenty of water</span><br>

While studying for exams and even during an exam, it is advisable to drink water. Remaining hydrated is vital and adds to your overall positive mood.<br>
<span style ="font-weight:bold;">11. Put God First In Everything You do</span><br>

A Large population of the student community are Christians. Devil comes to kill destroy and steal, your graduation and education is something of high value that the fallen angel has eyes on and can easily take it from you if you lack the proper spiritual protection. So put your studies and school work in God's hand and pray without ceasing and he will not fail you.<br>
<span style ="font-weight:bold;">12. Do Not Be Distracted</span><br>
Alcohol, smoking, chi cup everyday, partying and extended outings with baby mamas and boyfriends are not good for your academic journey because they compromise your commitment. Soon you start missing class and sitting on academic time. Your CA depends on your effort during the semester or term. One way to prepare for the exam is ensure that you have a good CA in each subject. That will also boost your confidence going into the exam. Do not make future appointment to study later when the exam approaches do it now or plan to use guns when you do not have the proper strategy of concealing it. Where you do not understand ask a friend or tutor or uncle Google. Failing even one subject is not sexy it stains the transcript lol. Using these techniques I have never sat for a sup out of the twenty exam sits I have had so far.
