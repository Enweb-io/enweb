            When it comes to writing assignments, it is difficult to find a conceptualized guide with clear and simple tips that are easy to follow. That’s exactly what this guide will provide: few simple tips on how to write great assignments, right when you need them. Some of these points will probably be familiar to you, but there is no harm in being reminded of the most important things before you start writing the assignments, which are usually determining on your credits.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Outline and Introduction</span><br>
Preparation is the key to success, especially when it comes to academic assignments. It is recommended to always write an outline before you start writing the actual assignment. The outline should include the main points of discussion, which will keep you focused throughout the work and will make your key points clearly defined. Outlining the assignment will save you a lot of time because it will organize your thoughts and make your literature searches much easier. The outline will also help you to create different sections and divide up the word count between them, which will make the assignment more organized.<br>

The introduction is the next important part you should focus on. This is the part that defines the quality of your assignment in the eyes of the reader. The introduction must include a brief background on the main points of discussion, the purpose of developing such work and clear indications on how the assignment is being organized. Keep this part brief, within one or two paragraphs.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Structure and aim:</span><br> This assignment will elaborate and discuss the specific pattern of obesity epidemic development, as well as its epidemiology. Debt, trade and globalization will also be analyzed as factors that led to escalation of the problem. Moreover, the assignment will discuss the governmental interventions that make efforts to address this issue.<br>


<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Critical thinking </span> <br>Academic writing has to be characterized by critical thinking, not only to provide the work with the needed level, but also because it takes part in the final mark.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Continuity of ideas</span><br>When you get to the middle of assignment, things can get confusing. You have to make sure that the ideas are flowing continuously within and between paragraphs, so the reader will be enabled to follow the argument easily. Dividing the work in different paragraphs is very important for this purpose.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Usage of ‘you’ and ‘I’ </span><br>According to the academic writing standards, the assignments should be written in an impersonal language, which means that the usage of ‘you’ and ‘I’ should be avoided. The only acceptable way of building your arguments is by using opinions and evidence from authoritative sources.<br>
          </p>
    
          <blockquote>
            <p style ="text-align:justify; font-size:16px;">"You’ve got to get up every morning with determination if you’re going to go to bed with satisfaction."
            </p>
          </blockquote>

            </div>
        
          </div>
      
          <p style ="text-align:justify; font-size:16px;"><span style ="font-weight:bold;">Referencing </span><br>this part of the assignment is extremely important and it takes a big part in the final mark. Make sure to use either Vancouver or Harvard referencing systems, and use the same system in the bibliography and while citing work of other sources within the text. <br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Usage of examples</span> <br> A clear understanding on your assignment’s topic should be provided by comparing different sources and identifying their strengths and weaknesses in an objective manner. This is the part where you should show how the knowledge can be applied into practice.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Numbering and bullets </span><br>Instead of using numbering and bullets, the academic writing style prefers the usage of paragraphs.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Including figures and tables</span> <br> The figures and tables are an effective way of conveying information to the reader in a clear manner, without disturbing the word count. Each figure and table should have clear headings and you should make sure to mention their sources in the bibliography.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Word count </span><br> the word count of your assignment mustn’t be far above or far below the required word count. The outline will provide you with help in this aspect, so make sure to plan the work in order to keep it within the boundaries.<br>

<span style ="font-weight:bold;">The importance of an effective conclusion</span><br>
The conclusion of your assignment is your ultimate chance to provide powerful arguments that will impress the reader. The conclusion in academic writing is usually expressed through three main parts:<br>



<span style ="font-weight:bold;">Summarizing the main points briefly</span><br>

Providing final comments with consideration of the future (discussing clear examples of things that can be done in order to improve the situation concerning your topic of discussion).<br> Last but not the least always consult with the lecturer or tutor if you are unclear about anything. That way you will know what is expected of you.
