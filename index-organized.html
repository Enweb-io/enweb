Have you ever experienced a mysterious moment where you walk into the kitchen to pick a folk and you cannot find one? You know that there should be over two dozen folks but you cannot lay you eyes on one. The sink is empty but all folks are missing. A few days later all folks there. Other times it is the spoon or the knife they just vanish then return after some times.<br>
That can happen and has happened in a bakery. The client is early she is waiting then boom you cannot find a utensil and there is no backup. This is more likely to happen if you bakery is not well organized. Therefore keep most used items within easy reach.<br>
The first thing you do in the morning is check that everything is in place and that everything that is to be used is good to go. It is good practice to have at least a pair or more of each utensil in that case you will have backup in case one vanishes or a niece or nephew turns it into a joy.<br>
Categorize your ingredients and baking products, group them into related products so that food color has its own place, sprinkles have their own place, flavors and essence have their own place. That way it will be easy for you pick what you need. You can use shelves or drawers to store such items. .<br>
Avoid putting baked products on lower shelves or on or near the floor these places are reachable by dirt, dust, pets and kids. Pets are not allowed in the bakery and they know it but some are stubborn and they are fast and they have appetite.<br>
Do not allow the bakery to turn into a furnace have proper air circulation with large meshed windows. You can also use an aircon or a fan .<br>
Icing a cake is done better when you are standing which makes a stool a little useless correct me is I am wrong. However standing for too long working on one of those rich young mum cakes that carry the theme of the wedding cake but is for a two year old boy might be tiring. It can lead to fatigue and discomfort which is why a high stool is recommend so that you easily reach the shelf. .<br>
Keep the shelf free of foreign object, neat and clean. Avoid over crowding and have enough work space. Constantly wash you utensils so that flour or other ingredients do not dry up on the surfaces of the utensils when you still need to use them. .<br>
You have to bake three cakes at 23 hours only to realize that there are no eggs. You send a whatsapp message to a fellow baker within reach to ask for eggs she returns the message a that I cannot open this message because I am sleeping. Then the next day you will over load.  When you do not get a lot of orders you get comfortable with fewer ingredient that bad for business ensure that you are always stocked and ready to take any order. .<br>
When I pick eggs for baking I tell the supplier that these are for baking. White flower is used therefore no eggs with chicken poo poo. If you select eggs and avoid those are stained you will make a loss. So ensure that you get clean cleans. .<br>
Electrical cords on the floor or walkways is a no. Keep all cords behind the seen. Keep the floor free of objects as well. The last thing you want is to fall while you are carrying a customerâ€™s cake because you got entangled in cord. Keep the sink and baking ovens separated .<br>
