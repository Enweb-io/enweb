The customer is always right is a figure of speech designed to remind entrepreneurs and business owners that without a client base they do not exist and so they should treat customers professionally with dignity and respect. That includes customers from hell as well.  It is accepted wisdom that customer service is one of the most important facets of a business, if not the single most crucial, playing a significant role in determining success or failure.<br>
We have clients that use profanity and curse, they threaten to sue and destroy businesses and some of them have the means. 
Handling customer complaints is a business process that involves listening to the client and devising a solution. However it is not acceptable for a customer to insult you. That is something you should not allow because it is damaging both at a business and at a personal level. A client is not at liberty to use abusive language if it bleeds down to that and the conversation is over the phone cut the call and block the number.<br>
Now what if this confrontation is in person? Hiding is not a solution, I was sent once to deal with a client from hell because the baker was not interested of confrontation, some bakers tell memebers of staff to inform the client that they are not available. A time will come when you will come face to face with such customers. <br>

The first thing to do is to remain calm and not respond in kind. If you're faced with an unexpected verbal attack, a natural defense mechanism is to "bite back."  So avoid "fighting fire with fire." And be tactful, or you risk inflaming the situation further and avoid retaliating in a way that might lead to you being viewed as the aggressor. That would be bad for business and scare away potemtialand future client.<br>
The first thing is to find a solution to the problem. Give the customer what they want and they will leave you in peace. If a genuine complaint has been launched then listen to the customer and provide a solution. The situation will not be provoked further. But can you always give the customer what they want? Not always.<br>
Here is where the power of teamwork comes to play. Imagine she returned half a cake that she collected fours days ago and wanted a refund because the cake was dry. She has no proof that the cake was dry and she has devoured half of it. No one is dumb enough to process a refund. If one person handles the client and she blows up then backup is required. First of all remind the client that they cannot use offensive language or they will be asked to leave. Secondly team up and stand ground and it will be easier for you to contain the situation. <br>

Beware of the legal aspect of the situation and proceed with caution. The last thing you want is your client to sumone authorities. The consequences of not handling confrontations effectively can be serious, both for individuals and their organizations. Poorly managed disputes can lead to a costly law suit and if you are a small business that would be the end of you. An entire company can suffer if its reputation is damaged, and you may lose business if you get too many of these encounters wrong. <br>

So, instead of taking someone's rudeness to heart, try to empathize with your customer – up to a point. They want to know that you're listening to them, and recognize the depth of their feelings, so show that you do. However, your response must not be dictated by the strength of their emotions. Developing emotional intelligence is a useful strategy for sensing other people's emotional needs, while retaining enough self-control to make the right response.<br>

Rude customers often need to vent their frustration. Always listen actively, no matter how unreasonable they sound. Demonstrate that you've taken in what they've said by occasionally reflecting back their words. For example, use phrases like, "So, it sounds like you're saying that…" "What I'm hearing is…" or "Is this what you mean?" This approach can also highlight any unrealistic expectations that may be behind the customer's complaint.<br>
Finally there is nothing wrong with black listing or blocking clients that have the potential to bring your business down. Some of these people of which a majority are women come with evil intentions. They have used words like, "I will shut your tiny bakery down". That is not coming froma good place.
