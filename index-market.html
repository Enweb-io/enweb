							1. INVEST IN A LOGO<br>
							 <img src="custom/logo.jpg" style="width:100%;"> <br>
Brand identity is used to isolate a business entity so that it stands out among its competitors. It is ease to trust and engage with branded businesses. Potential clients take branded business entities very serious there by creating required customer royalty. <br>
	2. USE BRANDED T-SHIRTS FOR EVENTS<br>
	<img src="custom/124.jpg" style="width:100%;"> <br>
Bakery owners constantly participate in baking events like baking lessons, baking expos, cake tasting and product presentations. Using branded T-shirt bearing the mark of your bakery at these events adds a professional touch to the event and people take the event more serious.<br>

3. USE PRODUCT CARDS<br>
<img src="custom/Yellocupcakehexa.jpg" style="width:100%;"> <br>
If you are a busy baker attending to social media queries can be overwhelming. If you post a beautiful chelsea football cake on facebook, the first reaction is, "wow it is beautiful how much is it"? This is because your image does not carry extra information. If you include more details you will be talking to your clients while you are working. That is where product cards come in. They provide the client with all the information they need about your baked products inclusive of pricing and contact information. Use elegant eye catching designs.<br>
4. USE BLAZE CARDS<br>
<img src="custom/redwhitesquare.jpg" style="width:100%;"> <br>
A blaze card is a product card that is forwarded to friends and family so that they can post on their social media pages and advertise the product on your behalf. Send the card to as many people as possible so that they can put it on whatsapp status or facebook stories. That way more eyes are brought to the product. Keep in mind the the more people you share with the better. <br>
5. USE DISCOUNT COUPONS<br>
<img src="custom/discount.jpg" style="width:100%;"> <br>
A discount coupon is a promotion flyer that highlights a discount or a sale. It shows the discount in percentage and it might also show the old price. Most people will compare your new price with the average common price. So before you make a discount for any cake find out the cost of that cake by other bakers otherwise your discounted price maybe 400 and another baker can do the same cake at 380. Then your discount has become invalid.  <br>
6. USE A CAKEBOOK<br>
<img src="cake/12.jpg" style="width:100%;"> <br>
A cakebook is a poweful marketing tool. It is a  photo gallery blog that showcases categorized galleries of your baked products. It also provides your potential clients with relevant business information. A cakebook functions like facebook albums but it focuses more on product presentaion. It only features the best products of each type of cake. Famous categories include, chocolate, football, cupcake, wedding e.t.c. Each gallery has a comment form where a client can ask about a specific cake product. Once you have your cakebook you can post links on social media so that your fan base has access to the gallery. You can send the link to friends and family and ask them to share as well.<br>
7. USE A WHATSAPP ORDERING SYSTEM<br>
<img src="cake/13.jpg" style="width:100%;"> <br>
This is a simple online shop layout that allows your customer to place an order by simply clicking on a whatsapp button placed under each product. The message will be generated that will inlude the product name and the order request. This one requires a bit of complex engineering. The advantage of both a cakebook and a whatsapp ordering system is that they both use affordable web technologies. You will get the same functionality as a minimal website. You can even do the blog by yourself with minimal functionality of course. <br>
