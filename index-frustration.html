As a baker you will learn that some practices have nothing to do with the recipe or procedure for baking your product. However beginners may not know that the recipe is not the only thing they need to pay attention too.  If you place a cake in the oven without pre heating you will have unexpected results. If you open the oven a few minutes after placing your cake you will have issues. If you get tempted to vary your temperature because you think the cake is baking too slow you will have a bad cakery day, over beating and under beating your mixture will render the same. <br>A watery mixture is not the way to go neither is a too thick mixture.  Lamps in your mixture are not acceptable. When the cakes are done remove them from the oven do not just run it off because the oven will take about another 15 minutes to completely cool down. <br>Do not over fill the baking tray if the cake over flows and spill on the red hot element a flame will be born destroy everything in the oven, I have witnessed a flame in the oven and the cake was corrupted by the smoke.  These practices will help you avoid failure and frustration.<br> 
Recipe time does not always work, your recipe may say one hour fifty minutes and that time might pass before you cake is completely done. Sometimes it is the opposite, you need to constantly check the cakes as they bake. You do not need to open the oven the light in there is enough for your to see what is going on. Do not go away and set alarm for a time lapse that equals the baking time.<br>
Read through the recipe. Make sure you have all of the ingredients you need. Sounds simple right? But I’m sure it’s happened once or twice where you’ve started a recipe, only to realize half way through that you’re missing a key ingredient.<br>

Yep, the whole recipe. Read through the directions as well. Being prepped for what comes next saves time and frustration as there are often multiple things you can be doing at once.<br>

Prepare each ingredient carefully paying attention to quantity. Yes, before, you heat up that stove and start baking anything. Ensure that all the ingredients are available in the right quality. Ensure that your supply is always stocked, do not run into issues of missing ingredients. Get delivery subscription so that your flour, icing sugar, custor sugar and other heavy products are delivered to your business premises. That will make your work very ease because you will not have to worry about getting those by yourself. <br>



Try it out and let me know how it goes! Do you have any other baking techniques that save you time or make your life as a baker easier? These baking practice will help you to avoid reeros and unwanted results. That you you get to keep a calm mind and collected heart ready to move forward without frustration.
